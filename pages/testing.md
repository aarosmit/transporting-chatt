- [Transporting Chattanooga](Home) is my personal blog that advocates for fiscally-responsible and sustainable infrastructure spending, zoning practices, and city management, with the side effect of (hopefully) creating a nicer, safer Chattanooga.
- Much of my inspiration for this blog comes from the work of [Strong Towns](https://www.strongtowns.org). They've been advocating for better cities for over a decade and have a wealth of information readily available [on their website](https://www.strongtowns.org).
- As with many other blogs, these opinions are my own and you may agree or disagree. If you're interested in further discussion, [please contact me](mailto:info@transportingchatt.com).
